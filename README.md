# Popular Movies

Here is an android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program.

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:
    ```
    app/gradle.properties
    ```
